The fpllowing commands use 'wget' to create web requests
with the intention to mimic a Dos attack. Using wget will
create files on your Jump-Box, use -O /dev/null to avoid.

from your Jump-Box :

with "for" loop.

Run : for i in {1..1000}; do wget 10.0.0.7 -O /dev/null; done

it will create 1000 web requests, files will be sent to /dev/null. 


with "while" loop.

Run : while true; do wget 10.0.0.7 -O /dev/null; done

it will create web requests.

the "true" loop will never stop, press ctrl + c to quit.


the following command will create web requests on all 3 vm's.

with nested loop.

use when vm's ip's are in sequence.
                   
Run : while true; do for i in {4..6}; do wget -O /dev/null 10.0.0.$i; done; done

use when vm's ip's are not in sequence and need to be listed explicitly.

Run : while true; do for i in 7 9 10; do wget -O /dev/null 10.0.0.$i; done; done

the "true" loop will never stop, press ctrl + c to quit.
